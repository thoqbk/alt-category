''Note: since this particular category is added to very regularly when people use the [[:Template:Bio-stub|bio-stub template]], active efforts to move biographical stubs into topical biography stubs, or convert stubs into larger articles, are greatly appreciated''.
*For stub articles sorted by country or region, see '''[[:Category:People stubs by nationality]]'''
*For stub articles sorted by occupation, see '''[[:Category:People stubs by occupation]]'''
*Do '''not''' use {{tl|bio-stub}} for the entries of [[fictional characters]] &amp;ndash; use {{tl|fict-char-stub}} instead.
*A good biography article should include all of these items, if possible:
** When and where the person lived.
** What they did in life that made them significant enough to be in this encyclopedia.
** Add at least one explicit category under [[:Category:People]], possibly a profession and/or a nationality and don't forget a sort tag.
